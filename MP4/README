=====Design decisions=====

I used mp4_inode_permission to handle all the permission logic, and removed the function handle for mp4_permission.

I used an if statement to check if the running task had the SID target, and depending if it did or not, the correct switch statement to properly decide correct access.

=====Code Status=====
My code is fully functional and implements least privilege for /usr/bin/passwd.

=====Testing=====
I used test.perm and test.perm.unload to verify proper access control. I changed the xattr being set, and verified the correct behavior happened.

=====Least Privilege Policy=====

I ran /usr/bin/passwd when the enforcement was no active (mp4_inode_permission would always return true), and printed the path in question when the access should have been denied. I then traced through all the valid paths, and set them accordingly. The full list of paths and their permissions can be found in passwd.perm.
